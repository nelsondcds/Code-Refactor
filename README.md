# Code-Refactor by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor. The challenge consists of taking the provided code and refactoring it. This includes improving the codebase for long-term sustainability and consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
